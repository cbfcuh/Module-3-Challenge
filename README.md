# Module-3-Challenge
Week 3 challange - Payroll Tracker

# Description
In this activity we were tasked with modifying the starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This was done when the manager is able to:
- Add employee(s) first name, last name and salary
- The average salary of all employees was calculated and displayed in the console
- A random employee is pick at random to be a drawn winner

# Installation
To repliate this activity you can start by: 
1. Cloning the provided documents located in this <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/curly-potato">Github</a> repository.
2. Navigate to the relevant directory
3. Open the files in your prefferred browser.

Once the webpage has been loaded, make the necessary changes to the starter code for it to function as described. This consist of but not limited to creating "loops", "if/else" statements and "functions" for the tracker to work.

Shown below is the attempt I have taken to make the Payroll Tracker work:

# Complications
One of the main complications was I had create a loop for the user to input the required data, however, I did not create an array nor did I store the data anywhere. Through online research, I learnt that I had to use the ".push" method to save the managers input into an array. To learn more about this you can head over to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push">MDN Web Docs</a> to read more about the method.

# Improvements
Personally I find that this web application is far from perfect and a lot can be done to what I have written to make it function better, such as:
- Having the names entered to uppercase automatically using ".UpperCase", I was unable to pinpoint where to utilise this.
- Rather than have the use type "Yes/No" to add the next employee, the use of a button would be more effective.
